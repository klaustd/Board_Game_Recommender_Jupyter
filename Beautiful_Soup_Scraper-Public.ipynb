      "<description>Blue J&amp;rsquo;s is a strategy game where the game grows into any shape as the cards are played out. Matching colors and/or symbols and placing them on the Start card is how the game begins. You force the other player(s) to draw cards based on how many complete squares you match. If you run out of cards you win the round or go for the quick win and match the Blue J&amp;rsquo;s. If you collect the most of nine Blue J&amp;rsquo;s Round Winner Tokens you win the game!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>Redcoats and Rebels-&amp;Eacute;lan for the American War of Independence is a collaborative work based on the recently released &amp;Eacute;lan Deluxe rules for 10-25 mm miniatures by Phillip Jones with special contributions from Messrs Mark Hume (AWI specific rules and army lists), Chris Johnson (more army lists) and Greg MacPherson (campaign rules).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Presented in a style similar to &amp;Eacute;lan Deluxe, (which was recently downloaded for the 10,000th time!), Redcoats and Rebels is well indexed and written in a straightforward clause style.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At nearly 100 pages including play charts, the zipped PDF file also has internal bookmarks for ease of navigation and includes campaign and optional rules, numerous specific unit and general ratings, battle scenarios and orders of battles for several actions in the AWI.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is scaled for 1:25, but can be used at the 1:10 to 1:50 ratio and uses any basing system.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The rules sequence features both simultaneous and alternate actions, resulting in an intuitive and balanced game that captures the feel of the period. Individual units represented are the battalion and regiment and players can do sub-unit actions such as company and squadron actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The complexity of the game is moderate, and would appeal to a player who enjoys small unit tactics and a wide latitude of unit options (within historical parameters) on the table.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>In Salvar Do&amp;ntilde;ana, several environmental problems have emerged simultaneously in the Do&amp;ntilde;ana National Park. The players are expert naturalists whose mission is to discover a solution for each of the four environmental problems before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, the active player can use up to four actions to travel from one point to another, mitigate environmental problems, discover a solution, or build control centers. A deck of cards will provide players with these abilities, but they will have to be careful with the catastrophe cards, which will accelerate and intensify environmental problems. A second deck of cards will control the inevitable expansion of environmental problems within the National Park.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Assuming a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to combine the strengths of their specialties to conquer the solution to environmental problems. But if one or more of those problems extends beyond the point of no return or if too much time passes, all players will lose. If they find a solution to the four environmental problems in time, the players will win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The winner of a trick will &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; each of the dishes played.  Instead of playing to a trick traditionally, a player can order more food - playing their card face down to the trick, but also adding a card from the undealt cards to their score pile.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of a hand, players earn positive points if they have taken 10 or fewer cards, and 0 points if they've taken more than 10.  However, if a player has taken 10 cards and there is exactly 1 of each suit, they immediately win; otherwise, the player with the most points over the course of 4 rounds wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>The Russian Front witnessed the biggest tank battles in history.  But for the crews of those vehicles, within each moment, each split second, there was only ever one target in their sights, or the one muzzle that remained unaccounted for.  &amp;#10;Commander, loader, driver&amp;hellip;they served in a cramped world, where the events of four bloody years became nothing but an endless succession of fights for a bridge, a village, or a way out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is Panzerkampf.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Panzerkampf pitches you into the fight via a short set of rules that have colour and detail where it matters.  Your ace crew, veterans of many such engagements, may conquer all, live to fight another day, or be killed outright by that next unseen muzzle flash.&amp;#10;Protection, hitting power, speed, and crew experience are fundamental to the game.  But no one survives without luck, representative of which are a number of random events that can help sway the balance one way or another.  Engines stall; turrets jam; and from out of the sky come Stukas and Sturmoviks.  Their cannon are deadly, but can they always tell friend from foe?&amp;#10;You fight on any flat surface, manoeuvring your force of realistic miniatures and making use of the battlefield terrain supplied with the package.&amp;#10;To get you started, the basic set of Panzerkampf offers 3 T34/41 tank models and 3 Panzer IVf1 models, as well as a supply of scenery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Players attempt to eliminate as many of their bad habits as possible in 7 days. On the last day, they summarize their results together, discussing each bad habit in turn.

      "<description>This is a never-released version of Black Rose Wars created by Ludus Magnus Studios. It is for 2 players and follows the basic rules of the original Black Rose Wars game with minor adjustments. It is a cut-out game contained within the Fourth edition of the LMS magazine called Ashes. It contains a folded board with a smaller Lodge that has 2 mage sheets printed near the edges. It comes with 1 new school of magic 'Agony' and 3 forgotten spells.  There are no events or quest cards, instead those are printed on the game board and events are followed over the 3 turns of the game. The players control 2 new mages and can summon a new evocation called a succubus to inflict damage to others and pain upon themselves. This is a great way to introduce new players to the world of Black Rose Wars. Games are estimated at 30-60 minutes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

It’s pretty simple to learn but the game has depth to it, which I always love.

The components and art are fantastic, especially for spooky season lovers. Absolutely thrilled I took the leap and backed it! \"></comment>\n",

Really liked the variation in player board powers and AIs to play against.  I also like that you can pick and choose if you do the concoction cards - it's always good to have done one or two to boost points but not a must have.  This will be a great filler game at game night.  It's something that would be an easy teach and once players have played a game they will really get into the strategy of decisions.\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>Deep within the darkness of Ulgu, Realm of Shadows, lies an impossible maze sequestered far beneath the sea. Two warbands brave the twisting shadow-magics of this ancient place, one spurred by divine decree and the other by selfish rapacity. Success may mean escape and survival, but few return from Harrowdeep &amp;ndash; the nightmare abyss where light itself withers and dies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enter the ultimate competitive miniatures game with the Warhammer Underworlds: Harrowdeep Core Set. Inside, you'll find everything you need to start gaming below the waves of the Shadowsea, with miniatures, dice, cards, and more. Harrowdeep marks the beginning of season five of Warhammer Underworlds &amp;ndash; a fast-paced, deck-based skirmish game set in the Mortal Realms. You can play right out of the box using the pre-built decks for the Rivals format &amp;ndash; which is new to this season &amp;ndash; or you can hone your deck using cards from the Warhammer Underworlds card pool for a strategic challenge.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;NOTE: The card back graphics in this set do not match those of all the previous games released in the Warhammer: Underworld series. You will not be able to mix and match cards from other previous sets with this one to deck build a unique team.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

What&amp;rsquo;s worse, the ultimate gem to rule them all has been forged into a single, mighty scepter. Whoever holds it wields even more power at an even greater price.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Puzzle Strike 2, players build their deck as they play, giving them the tools to arrange and manipulate their set of colored gems. These gems can be &amp;ldquo;crashed&amp;rdquo; (destroyed) in order to build up power for four different super moves as well as to flood other players with more gems. As this process unfolds, gems will fly back and forth between players as they desperately try to remain under the threshold of corruption. Holding the scepter &amp;ldquo;helps,&amp;rdquo; but can also doom the greedy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "David Sirlin has outdone himself again with another fantastic game. However, I continue to question his marketing and business decisions as a publisher. The box art and overall aesthetic give off the wrong impression, making it seem like a kids game, when in fact it's a legit deep strategic deckbuilding game. On top of that, I just can't understand why they included an actual toy scepter (that literally takes up half the box) with the game - when it could have just been a poker or cardboard chip. I strongly believe this component alone alienated a lot of potential backers. \n",

As a fan of duel games and deck builders like Slay the Spire, this game scratches that itch in a fast paced and frenetic package.  Sirlin's design philosophy around asymmetric starts (based around his characters that appear in Yomi, Puzzle Strike and Codex) shines brightly in PS2 - I have played about half of the base box characters and feel each of them play very differently if you lean into their strengths.  The unique 'crash' system is a great spin on attacking your opponents as it requires some careful planning; these plans however are often trumped by chaotic miracle turns.  \n",

      "The components are beautiful.  The gems have a premium look and feel, and actually add to the gameplay as opposed to some games (looking at you CMON Games) where miniatures or components are just there to jack up the price and do nothing else.

The card row and how it influences the gem order is a stroke of genius. Right now I'm giving this game a 9, but that's because I have no doubt that it will continue to get better in the future (right now it might really be more like an 8 for me mainly because turns take too long and get a bit too crazy imo).

      "<comment rating=\"9.25\" username=\"kalchio\" value=\"&quot;Overall, I thought Rainforest City was a blast, even if I keep accidentally calling it Rainforest Café. That place was haunted. It sticks with you. Thankfully, Rainforest City sticks with you, as well. I actually really like the card drafting technique. It's a nifty one, reminiscent of two games I quite enjoyed mixed together, which appeals to me greatly. The game's also very appealing, both thematically and artistically. It's a good-looking game and I really like games that teach the importance of conservation and ecology. It's a good look. There are also a surprising number of variants for the game, which I appreciate, even if it means more things I need to consider in my review. I think the token placement makes this game a bit reminiscent of Remember Our Trip, another of Daryl's designs, mostly because it has similar complex token placement mechanics. Here, however, instead of creating large groups of the same token, you're creating functional groups of different tokens to build out food chains. I like that a lot. It's challenging, but with a smaller footprint than Remember Our Trip, both in terms of teaching and just general spatial complexity. I think both games are dynamite, though, so, can't go wrong. I'm a sucker for a spatial reasoning game, especially one with cool cards and challenging spatial puzzles, so this was always going to throw me for a loop, though. If you're looking for a sharp game from a fantastic designer, I'd definitely recommend checking Rainforest City out! I really liked it.&quot;\n",

I'm really into nature and animal themes - and I have to say that I've been playing a lot of really good games with that theme lately - this is one of them. It's such a fun game that works perfectly with just 2 players. The &quot;drafting&quot; mechanism is really great and I'm not sure if I've seen it before? This little game is a lot of fun for us. You have to build your landscape and take care of the plants and animals. You only get points if they are supported in their area.

      "In the puzzle game Rainforest City, you are going to rebuild the natural landscape in Singapore. You will strategically reconstruct rainforests, mangroves and oceans. The game is played in 12 turns with a different starting player each turn. On your turn, you choose a set of 2 cards from the fruit dial. These are 2 terrain cards, 2 flora and fauna cards or a combination. You place the terrain cards in your playing area. This is how you expand your nature reserve. A flora and fauna card tells you where to put flora and fauna tokens in your nature reserve. You then discard these cards. If you cannot place tokens or have to discard them, they go into your compost heap. In a contiguous area of the same colour, you want to make sets of flora and fauna tokens of value 1, 2 and 3. For a token of 2, you only get points if there is also a value 1 in this area. The same goes for the 3, which must be supported by a 2. At the end of the game, you get points for all tokens that match the area and tokens that are supported. You get 3 points per house, but -1 point per adjacent token and also -1 point per token in your compost pile. The one with the most points wins!\n",
      "\n",
      "⭐ Our review:\n",
      "Rainforest City is a very fun, challenging puzzle with a very strong theme that tries to raise awareness of the disappearance of Singapore's rainforest. The tokens look just like plastic and look good. It also comes with a cool informative booklet that explains the different animals featured in the game that really live in Singapore's rainforest. There is also a solo, cooperative, simple and challenge variant.\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>Blacksmiths of Everland rejoice! The royal family of a prosperous kingdom has announced the new successor to the throne. To let the heir shine as bright as possible, the family has promissed a large reward for providing a unique crown. Forges from all over the nation are invited to join this competition. Gather your workers, mine beautiful gemstones and prove your craft skills. Whoever provides the most intriguing crown, is praised by the royals.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Crown Craft is a competitive game for up to 5 players, where every player tries to craft the most fantastic-looking crown. In order to do that they visit the mines, pick their desired gems, and socket them into the crown they have prepared. Gems are mined by rolling dice and pairing the results with the gem values to claim them. Most gems provide special effects, such as dice manipulation abilities and extra income, and of course, Victory Points.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players may use those gems to complete their crown, to sell them or to gift them to the academy. The latter will in return provide magical tools so they can upgrade their forges! Present the most beautiful crown at the end of the game, and win the royal families favor!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>In the 17th century, significant advancements were made in the field of science owing to the establishment of academic societies across Europe. As the leader of a faction within one such academic society, you must strive to earn prestige through your studies so that your faction can grow.&amp;#10;Myriad matters compete for your attention as you endeavor to maintain your influence in each of the sciences. Contributing to the kingdom&amp;rsquo;s growth by completing royal commissions, presenting your findings at conferences, and taking sabbaticals to gather knowledge in foreign lands are just a few of the tasks laid before you.&amp;#10;Will your quest for knowledge earn you prestige within your academic society and allow you to expand your faction?&amp;#10;c Society, you&amp;rsquo;ll compete to earn the most Prestige through the game&amp;rsquo;s three primary systems.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first system involves the society board&amp;rsquo;s action spaces. Each round, you&amp;rsquo;ll place your scholars on various action spaces and perform the corresponding main actions.&amp;#10;Some action spaces allow you to perform a bonus action in addition to a main action; however, since there aren&amp;rsquo;t many of these special action spaces, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to anticipate what the other players will do and act accordingly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second system involves the management board&amp;rsquo;s influence track. At the end of the game, you&amp;rsquo;ll earn Prestige from the spaces occupied by your scholars on this track.&amp;#10;You can also choose to remove your scholars from the influence track and use them to perform actions starting from the next round.&amp;#10;Once removed, scholars cannot be returned to the influence track, forcing you to choose between earning extra Prestige at the end of the game or having more scholars on hand to perform actions with.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The third system involves the sabbatical tracks on your player board. Advancing your scholars along these tracks will earn you permanent bonuses.&amp;#10;However, scholars assigned to a sabbatical track stay there for the rest of the game, which means you&amp;rsquo;ll have fewer scholars available to perform actions.&amp;#10;Deciding if and when to assign your scholars to these tracks will require careful consideration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As each of these systems involves your scholars, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to manage them wisely if you hope to emerge victorious.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

They make educational games about for example the flora and fauna, but also how destructive fires and poachers can be ? also, they use zero plastic in their games, so no plastic baggies, but paper. I thought that was very nice, reducing their ecological footprint ?\n",

      "In this game which takes about 20 minutes and plays 4 players from ages 6 and up, you are trying to score points by collecting wildlife in your forest, while protecting your habitat from forest fire and poachers ?\n",
      "\n",
      "On your turn you pick a card from the market and perform the action (place animal, move poachers, start a fire, or end game scoring points). Then you can perform up to 2 actions (may be the same): walking, planting a forest, saving an animal, or releasing the animal in the wild, i.e. on your forest tile ?\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when someone picks the poacher card, they will move him in a chosen direction, as many points as there are pips on the dice. If he encounters any wildlife, he will take it ? same for the forest fire: if a fire starts on one of your tiles, the tile and all animals on it, get discarded ?\n",

      "When a player plays their last tile, the game is over and points are scored. This is a fast paced game, little explanation, some choices and also luck because of the die rolls. I got to play a 2 player game and it was over before it started ? maybe with more players it will be more fun, but for now... it was okay?\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>In Colombia, every few years a cooking competition is held to highlight typical recipes from all regions of the country. &amp;#10;This is where a group of grandmothers who love cooking meet and display all their culinary knowledge in a fierce competition, where they decide who is the fastest and most seasoned grandmother.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Use your culinary skills to cook the most delicious Colombian dishes and be faster than your rivals to take home the title of Abuela Co. (Colombian Cooking Competition)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Abuela Co. is a game for 2 to 4 players, in which you will have to cook several typical dishes on a four-burner stove while avoiding other grandmothers to cook faster than you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play the cards on your stove. The grandmother who cooks 3 recipes finishes the game. The grandmother with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "Abuela Co is a Colombian design and the designer is a friend. I will rate it soon and I will probably add it to BGG´s database.\n",
      "\n",
      "As time passes, I´m harsher and harsher on games, perhaps because now I know what games I really like and I also try to follow BGG´s rating system as closely as I´m able to. Abuela Co is a good family level game but it is not a game for me as I want heavier games or fun light games. I´m the guy who hates Pandemic and Carcassonne and heavily dislike Ticket to Ride, so keep that in mind when you read my next words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abuela Co was presented to me by the designer, a personal friend. We played it on Tabletopia due to COVID19 restrictions and I had fun playing it. From my understanding the game has been tested several times.\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme Is about typical Colombian food, so you get to see dishes and deserts from many of our regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The art is pretty cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal is to be the abuela (grandma) with the most VPs at the end. To create a dish you have to first acquire the ingredients and you have to process some of them before been able to add them to the recipe, once you have all the correct ingredients you can cook the dish if it is still available. All is done via cards, and you can also play 3 different “take that” cards on your opponents. The game is all about getting the cards needed to cook the recipes available, each player has a 4 place stove to do this and there is also a communal stove.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is luck of the draw in how the cards appear but there are some mitigation elements (change cards from the pantry) or you can always pivot to cook something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, Abuela Co is a good family game, but It’s just not a game for me. The theme is charming. I will give my rating soon and I will probably buy it to support boardgames in my area.\n",

Each poker-sized card has one of Greenland's coastal villages - visit a new village each time you turn over a card. Starting with just a couple of basic resources, your aim is to gain as much money as you can in order to pay for your sea passage home, before you run out of time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Trade resources and learn new local skills as you travel between villages. Skills will gain you benefits later in the game, or help you avoid penalties, but learning a new skill means spending more precious time in that village. You'll need to decide when to invest in skills and when to push on to the next village.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With multiple solo and two player modes, this pocket sized game will keep you thinking for hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

If you translate German idioms into the English language you don't get the correct English equivalent, but rather a funny English sentence. Then it's not English, it's Denglish (&amp;quot;D&amp;quot; for Deutsch = German). So one by one the players draw a card and have to translate the Denglish sentences into German and then also have to find the correct English forms.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If a player can translate the Denglish phrase into German and then correctly into English they can keep the card. The more cards the players collect the more points they earn. Whoever earns most points wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>BookWorms is a simple word search game where players, acting as worms, find letters in adjacent books to form words.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;PLAY IN ROUNDS&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Play at least two rounds. Each round consists of setup and game play until the draw piles are depleted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAME PLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On each turn, the current player &amp;hellip;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Examines letters adjacent to and in a path of letters from their location.&amp;#10;     Calls out a word using any nearby letters and optionally one letter from a draw pile.&amp;#10;     Moves their bookworm to the location of the last letter used.&amp;#10;     Collects all the book tiles used. &amp;#10;     Places the tiles collected upside down in front of them.&amp;#10;     Takes a random tile from the draw pile and places it face up on any empty board space.&amp;#10;     Moves the mole.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The mole is used to steal a random book from an adjacent bookworm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Making a Move&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Move your bookworm onto a location where the first letter will be used to form your word. The location must be adjacent to, or within a continuous &amp;ldquo;tunnel&amp;rdquo; of five empty spaces from your worm&amp;rsquo;s current position. However, you cannot move next to, or pass next to the mole.&amp;#10;     The word will be a combination of adjacent letters in sequential order and optionally a letter or bigram from any draw pile.&amp;#10;     Call out the word for others to verify.&amp;#10;     Pick up the tiles used and them place in front of you upside down.&amp;#10;     Move the worm to the location of the last letter used.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TIP: Try to use letters with the highest values.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Moving the Mole&amp;#10;The current player moles the mole at the end of their turn. The mole is moved onto a book tile whose letter matches the first letter of the word just made.&amp;#10;If the mole is moved next to a worm, that player loses one of their collected letter tiles at random.  The current player selects one of the that player&amp;rsquo;s tiles and places it face up on a random board location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ENDING THE ROUND&amp;#10;When all players agree that no more words can be formed, the game is over. &amp;#10;Each player tallies their collected books&amp;rsquo; points and records them on a score sheet. Repeat the setup and play at least one more round.&amp;#10;Repeat the setup and play at least two rounds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;ENDING THE GAME&amp;#10;At the end of the last round, the winner will have the most points. In case of a tie, the youngest player wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>Dawn of Iron: The American Civil War at Sea, is a game of naval combat, set during American Civil War (1861-1865). While many think of the war&amp;rsquo;s naval campaigns as a static blockade, the truth is that it was actually just as desperate and bloody as other aspects of the conflict. From the coastal regions of Virginia and the muddy rivers of the Mississippi Valley to the far flung freezing waters of Alaska&amp;rsquo;s Bering Strait, Union and Confederate navies fought for dominance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dawn of Iron puts you in command of a Civil War-era vessel, or a full squadron of them. Assemble your fleet, engage the enemy, and send them to the bottom!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The 24-page Dawn of Iron rulebook includes all the rules you'll need to play in a concise 15-pages with diagrams and illustrations. There's also a few pages dedicated to open sea and coastal battlefields that you will fight on (riverine coming soon!) and four general play missions that should get you sailing in no time!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<comment rating=\"8\" username=\"Dameon\" value=\"A &quot;modern&quot; game design style rule set for Ironclads that has good depth to it but isn't mired in the 80's game design mindset of &quot;more complex = better&quot; nor a chart referencing morass. Players alternate activating their ships, with provisions for when one side is outnumbered, so it's not the standard you-go-I-go nor is activation subject to the randomness of a token/counter draw.  It is not a hex based system. The rules seam meant to handle smaller games (2-5 ships per side) and since most of the ironclad and river actions in the ACW were relatively small, this isn't really a problem. While there are considerably more ships in some of the full scenarios, I wouldn't want to try controlling a dozen ships (best to leave those to games with multiple players per side, each handling only a few ships). While by this period most ships could move under steam power, it does have adequate rules for wind and sailing. The main drawback of the game is that it is designed to be published as an expansion system and the designer seams to be focusing on specific battles*. There are no ship stats included in the main rules and there is no list of ship stats available outside of the expansions nor any guidelines for creating ships. The print-and-play counter set (a MUST HAVE) does include a simple version of the Hampton Roads scenario, but that's it.\n",

      "*Edited: There is a Facebook group for this game and the author has posted test stats for many ships, which are free to download. The various expansions so far have been of excellent quality, showing in-depth research and including expansive lists of all vessels that were in or around the various battles (even if they didn't directly participate).\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>The government of Maximilian, who inherited the reign over Bruges in 1482, is harsh and taxes are high, leading to public discontent. When Maximilian visited Bruges in 1488, the people decided to revolt. They were able to imprison their monarch for over four months. Out of vengeance, Maximilian imposed a prohibition to organize festivities and fairs. To calm him down, you as the people of Bruges decided to organize a celebration to honor Maximilian.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Parade of the Bruges fools players take on the role of a medieval labourer living in Bruges. Together, you try to gather musicians, acrobats and jesters to join a big parade in honour of Maximilian in order to earn his respect and therefore more freedom. However, the player who surpasses the expectations of grumpy Maximilian, wins this game and becomes mayor in Bruges.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each turn, players perform one of three actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     persuade an artist by offering a drink in the local bar&amp;#10;     play an artist into the parade and score (some artists have the possibility to move other cards one space or to swap with a card)&amp;#10;     rest (by taking back into your hand all of the cards you needed to persuade artists)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When an artist reached the seventh column, the parade is complete and the game ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In the advanced game mood bonusses are dealt to the player(s) who took most notice of the King's temper (3 out of 20 mission cards).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"GhaRe\" value=\"Draft &amp; Write Records brings a unique twist to the genre, introducing a refreshing drafting element that keeps each player's experience distinct. Also, as a musician, the theme of this game brings so much joy as I can identify so much with it! I think anyone that has ever been in a Band will have a blast! Also, those who don't identify with the theme, the cascade chain of actions due to one choice just brings an &quot;Oh My God I can now do this, and then unlock that,&quot; and so on! ? Super satisfying!\n",
      "\n",
      "The player boards may seem initially overwhelming, with their colorful and busy layout, but the rulebook provides a clear and straightforward guide to understanding each section. Each aspect of your board operates independently, and the rulebook takes you through them step by step. After a couple minutes all the icon design simply flow through the board and you immediately identify everything easily. Even if you are color blind, all colors have icons, helping you out if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't you hate when everyone is against you (since you are winning) and they simply destroy you as a group and you, in no way, can win? Well not in this game! The card drafting mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the game. Starting with five cards each round, players must choose one card and pass the others. This process keeps everyone engaged and ensures that no two games are the same. It's not about outsmarting your opponents; it's about maximizing your own score. I particularly enjoyed how the game promotes self-focused strategy rather than interference with other players.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heart of the game lies in building your band, creating harmonies, and pursuing goals. The cascading bonuses that can result from a well-executed turn are highly satisfying. However, these big combos require careful preparation, making the game feel less like a race and more like a gradual buildup to stardom. I played with different people and all of them were just amazed about how satisfying this chain of events is.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goals evaluation phase, where players strive to achieve common objectives, introduces variability and opportunities for bonus rewards. With a substantial goals deck, Draft &amp; Write Records encourages players to explore different paths to success and adapt to new objectives, adding depth to the gameplay. Also all the goals are sharable, so if someone does the goal at the same time that you do, both of you are rewarded. But don't stay behind, as those goals disappear once someone does them!! \n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, Draft &amp; Write Records brings the satisfaction of achieving cascading combos and the strategic depth make this game a worthwhile addition to the &quot;X and write&quot; genre, especially if you're a fan of the theme. It's a game that's definitely worth trying, whether you're a music lover or not. Congratulations!\"></comment>\n",

      "This is a solid draft and write game - the spots requiring money can be a bit irritating and you definitely have to acquire money to open spots. Also, realize the tempo of the game can be driven by accomplishing objectives and this may draw the game to a much quicker conclusion than you expected. The small value objectives can be easy to achieve if someone focuses on the crooked arrow area (which I believe is the assets area).  Does focus on creating combo chains to a degree as well.\"></comment>\n",

Have some concerns about replayability but I expect the greater challenge to getting it to the table is more the unforgiving aspects of the game.

      "<description>The bug city of Basin Quarter has been infested by pests from the &amp;quot;Hive&amp;quot; syndicate. Players are spider detectives moving through the city to capture these pests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round, dice are rolled to generate a small pool of movement options. Players simultaneously move their spiders on the board, drawing threads along their path. When an area is bounded by threads, it becomes a webbed area that can be used to catch pests.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each pest requires a specific condition to be caught, such as web size or spider position. Players must plan their paths carefully, and decide what targets to pursue or abandon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Victory points are gained through the capture of these pests, as well as a varied number of side objectives. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>Portals is a fun and strategic card game where you can create your own deck to battle your friends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Portals you battle against each other with 3 pre-chosen Champion cards to breach your opponents Stronghold represented by Breach Points. You can lower your opponent's Breach Points by battling his Champions and by opening Portals that can transfer you to other realms! &amp;#10;But beware, Champions can get stronger during the game, so watch your back!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Portals is a TCG where you create your own deck to play. Choose your 3 Champions to build your deck around, take the mutual Portal cards and place them in three piles between you and your opponent. You start with 4 cards in your hand. During your turn, you can play as many cards as you like and you may use every Champion for their attack and effect once, if you pay their Stamina cost. If a certain condition of your Champion is met, it gets empowered! This can change their stats and/or its effect. But watch out! Your Champions Breach points go up as well. So, if they get defeated you lose that many more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Big part of the game is opening Portals. Every Portal has a specific cost. By gathering enough allies from your deck in the corresponding zone, you can open the Portals and send them through to gain different effects and breach your enemy's Stronghold.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

We want to live in the present, and the only history that is worth a tinker's **** is the history we make today.&amp;quot; The famous founder is standing in front of his team giving a motivational speech. &amp;quot;You all know our first customer was a lunatic, and the second had a death wish. So they bought our brakeless bangers. So there were a few accidents. But the only mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. This year, customers demand safety. Of course, active safety features include rapid acceleration for safe overtaking! I know it will be hard to add the new motorblock section to the factory, but before you say you cannot do something, try it! To every engineer, every planner, every mechanic, and every salesperson in this great company I say: If I can dream it, you can do it!&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Horseless Carriage is a game about the dawn of the automobile, a time when cars were invented, and no one quite knew yet what this new contraption would look like and what features would be essential. Early cars sometimes used levers or pedals to steer and a wheel to accelerate. Brakes were not always seen as essential, but sometimes an outside spot to take along an onboard mechanic was. This early, super innovative period occurs in the development of many new product categories. Players are cast as aspiring industrialists trying to find out what features the public will value when buying these new, expensive, and utterly unfamiliar horseless carriages.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

I think that in general the fiddly Splotter games (this, Antiquity, Rbo) are just less fun to play than the ones with more manageable pieces (Bus, TGZ). Anyway, this is probably the best fiddly Splotter for me. The factory puzzle is just right where you can plan general shapes fast and it's easy to fuck yourself, but you can probably unfuck yourself too. Then the way this interacts with and lets you focus on the main part of the game is really satisfying. Reductive assessment via comparison: if the city board in Antiquity actually mattered + Indonesia's tech tree focus + Rbo's double ended turn order queue for good measure.\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>Recreate the Air War over the European theater of World War II as part of the epic clash between the Allies and Germans in some of the most historic battles of World War II, during the years 1941-1945.&amp;#10; Eagles Over Europe is a historical boardgame where players take the roles of US Army Airforce and the RAF (including the Polish pilots, of course!) to participate in WWII's most famous battles, including Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra, and the Ardennes (Battle of the Bulge).  You'll also deal with the bombing campaign, as Mustangs and Thunderbolts try to protect the B-17s from hordes of Luftwaffe fighters. &amp;#10;Eagles Over Europe includes over 15 battle scenarios, all fought out on a huge, 140 cm x 100 cm game board (55&amp;quot; x 39&amp;quot;). Each scenario recreates the historical objectives of the two sides, and includes special events that impacted the battle's outcome.&amp;#10;Eagles Over Europe is designed to be easy-entry, but the game mechanics require strategic card play and finding skillful combinations between the dice, the symbols on the cards, and pilot abilities. In addition to the huge gameboard, Eagles over Europe includes detailed airplane miniatures, beautifully illustrated Combat cards, Scenario, Event and Pilot cards. Special Terrain tiles and Custom dice complete the &amp;quot;wow&amp;quot; people will feel when they open the box. &amp;#10;Those familiar with the &amp;quot;303 Squadron&amp;quot; game will recognize the core game mechanics but enjoy additions like Flak, RADAR, ground attack, and many more. But you don't have to have 303 Squadron to play Eagles Over Europe-- it is a totally free-standing game. &amp;#10;Eagles Over Europe is designed as a co-operative game for 1 - 4 players. The average game length is between 60 and 90 minutes. Each scenario includes innovative and clever mechanics, dynamic gameplay, and startling surprises...all &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; for Eagles Over Europe!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

From the starting field, they travel through the American states and are allowed to move one step at a time when one of their 6 numbers is drawn. Events (chip win, chip loss) are triggered on some of the spaces reached. If all 6 numbers were drawn by a player, that player is allowed to go 6 more steps. Then all players have to buy a new lottery ticket and the procedure starts again.

      "<description>A naval-themed card game for 2 players. It is a card battler that borrows mechanics from war games by making units move around the board. Instead of a mana system, players can play ships for free but need to discard cards to move them around the board. Islands can be captured to increase one's draw power, but these are out of the way and come at the cost of tempo. Additionally, as ships begin to sink, the deck gradually thins, and eventually draw power becomes irrelevant in the end game.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Look at the picture and calculate or deduce correctly!&amp;#10;     If you did not roll 1, turn the card over and answer the question on the back next to the rolled number. These will put your memory to the test, but if you watch well, you will know the answer for sure!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There&amp;rsquo;s no reason to get frustrated even if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answer, turn the card over and find the solution!

      "<description>This is Your Captain Speaking launches you onto the deck of an interstellar spacecraft rife with cutthroat ambition. You might be boldly venturing across the galaxy in the pursuit of scientific discovery, but this is no sci-fi utopia. Everyone aboard this ship, from First Officer to Sewage Processor, has their eye on the coveted Captaincy. Will the beleaguered Captain hang on or will one of your scheming underlings manage to manoeuvre their way to the top?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In This is Your Captain Speaking, each player takes control of the fates of a range of crew members aboard the ship, attempting to get them onto 'away missions' where Commendations may be awarded - critical to success as a would-be Captain. Missions are dangerous, though - and depending on who it is that has influence on the right crew members at the right time, they could be fatal. Players jostle for the highest rank in each ship department, each of which confers powerful crew duties performed after each mission. Wrestle to the Captaincy, or sabotage your opponents in order to control the Bridge. This is Your Captain Speaking is the ultimate game in devious plans, shocking twists of fate and Captains starting from humble beginnings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round consists of a series of 'missions' and 'crew duties' capped off with a 'starbase' phase. Depending on who is in charge of which department, crew characters are selected to participate in a mission - which could be lucrative or perilous...each character rolls on the encounter table to see just how bad of a time they had off-ship. Which planet Navigation chose for them will dramatically affect the outcome of each mission. Woven throughout every phase of the game are devious 'schemes' that players can action to manipulate the circumstances of the crew to their advantage.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each mission is resolved (and any deceased crew members are removed and their underlings promoted), players then action the crew duties in order - with the highest-ranking character in each department wielding the powerful effects that round. Will they mitigate the impact of a mission, or take advantage of a crew member's injuries to promote their own. In each 'year', after two mission-duties cycles, the crew will stop off at a starbase to refuel (and for players to command control of more of the surviving crew...)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players win by either having one of their controlled characters in the Captain's chair holding at least three commendations at the end of a 'year', or at the end of three years having scored the most points across their controlled crew.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>Wayfarers of the South Tigris is set during the height of the Abbasid Caliphate, circa 820 AD. As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above. Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game's end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their progress. The game ends once one player&amp;rsquo;s marker has reached the far right column of the journal track.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

The art is engaging and the tableau you build connects into a seamless panorama that really draws you into the world you’ve built.\n",

The base game comes with 10 categories with 36 game cards in each as well as a 36 card cheat deck.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 categories are chosen at random. 6 Game cards from each chosen category are stacked below each matching category card. Play starts in the clockwise rotation. The player chooses a category and then selects the top card from its deck. They must now get the SA to say the word or name on the card, without saying it and by following other rules such as - no spelling, no present or past tense versions of the word etc.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When the 24 game cards are gone, the game is over, and the person with the most wins.

Players take on the role of adventurers who&amp;rsquo;ve completed their quest, and now are undergoing the process of divvying up loot scored during their epic undertaking. Characters clash in constant combat for coinage each round. The game is set in the recently rebranded City of Destiny&amp;trade;. A bustling boomtown transformed from the tiny hamlet of Po&amp;rsquo;Dunk. Where there was once a village on the verge of collapse, now stands a thriving metropolis filled to the brim with hustlers and cons. It has become the go-to place for every Hero, Villain, and Mercenary looking to find their place in the world and is in fact the number one tourist trap. The city&amp;rsquo;s ever-changing population leaves only its world-famous hospitality service in its wake. The only permanent fixture of the city being its Inns &amp;amp; Outcasts.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players start each turn by simultaneously placing a card face down, then counting up initiatives from 1-6. Once a card&amp;rsquo;s initiative is called, all cards of that initiative are revealed. Players make short decisions regarding the specifics of their abilities, then proceed until all cards are shown. When all cards are revealed, special abilities kick in which allows players to add coins to their personal hoard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players can make income either through their starting gold (a fixed amount of gold determined by each character card) or through their special abilities. Special abilities can come in the form of reveal effects &amp;ndash; which happen instantly, or through loot abilities which compound at the end of each turn. Loot abilities are high-risk, high reward as they can often be blocked by other cards. Once a card is played, it stays out until 5 turns have gone by, allowing all players to refresh their hands. It&amp;rsquo;s a game about reading your opponents and the situation at hand to make big gains while slowing down your opponents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player having the most money at the end of the game being the winner. The game ends once a player crosses a threshold of currency, which is determined by group size &amp;ndash; but just because you&amp;rsquo;re the first over the line doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee a win.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>In Word Stax, players build stacks of cards, trying to find words that fit an increasing number of conditions. Each card in hand gives players 2 choices of conditions to add to the conditions on the word stax in play. The more conditions, the more the stax are worth. If they can think of a word or phrase that fits all the conditions, they can claim the stack and all its points&amp;hellip;for now! Players are aided by special cards which allow them to manipulate the stax and claim them for their own!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;GAMEPLAY&amp;#10;&amp;#10;5 cards are laid on the table representing the intitial stax (7 for a 3 or 4 player game), and each player holds 3 cards and 5 cubes in their hands. On a turn, a player places a card such that one additional condition is added to the stack. The player says a word that fits all the conditions of the stack and claims it for their own by placing a cube on the stack, then draws a new card. Claimed stacks can be claimed by other players if they can add a card to the stack. Special cards allow players to perform other actions such as swap, remove, or rotate cards. If a player cannot play on a stack, they discard a card from their hand and lose a cube permanently. When all players have either run out of cubes or cards to play, the game ends and each player recieves points for their claimed stax.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Word Stax was an entry in the 2021 54-Card Game Contest, where it placed 4th for best solitaire game, and 6th overall.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Expand the world, gather the energy that's released when new pieces of land are connected, and raise massive natural spires from the ground to impress the other spirits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;World Stitchers is very easy to teach and quick to set up.

      "<comment rating=\"4\" username=\"The Cardboard Kid\" value=\"Original - 2022 12 09: World Stitchers is a drafting and tile placement game with set collection and race elements. It has a charming theme, and a handful of modules. I recommend anyone who isn't a gaming newcomer always use the Area Control module. It gives players reason to consider the overall map, their spatial relationship with others, and bumps up interaction a bit. Otherwise, while there are some good ideas, it feels incomplete and bland compared to games like Fields of Green, and has too much downtime to steal the family crown away from Kingdomino.\"></comment>\n",

The game includes three different major battles: Blankenfeld; Gross Beeren; and Dennewitz which pit the Prussians under Prince Von Bulow and their Russian and Swedish allies against the French Imperial forces under first Marshal Oudinot and then Marshal Ney. Each battle has roughly 60,000-80,000 per side, as the French stretch their multi-national forces to knock the Coalition armies, infused with large numbers of patriotic Landwehr, out of what was to be called the War of Liberation&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The package also includes the bonus game, La Bataille de Hagelberg 1813, ME&amp;rsquo;s previously free print and play game, with a professionally produced map and counters for the first time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The entire package has over 600 counters; eight maps; and access to ME&amp;rsquo;s an over 100-page book with Premier rules; extensive special rules; and multiple historical articles; and many charts and other play-aids.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>It has been months since the Coven&amp;rsquo;s Supreme Witch disappeared from Salem Slot village without leaving a trace. The haughtiness and impatience of the novice witches make them compete for the position of the new Supreme Witch. Who will have the greatest power to summon the Dark Lord during the Full Moon nights?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This game simulates the mechanics of slot machines. The objective of the game will be to get combinations of cards by following the panel of game prizes, similar to the slot machines ones and represented in game cards that can be consulted at any moment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In this game there are 6 different types of moon cards. Each player will draw one card of each type from the so-called &amp;quot;moon phases&amp;quot; (the first 5) and will receive 3 Treat Coins that are used to pay for card exchanges. &amp;quot;Wild&amp;quot; cards will also appear. These will give a certain strategic advantage to the players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When a player finishes his exchanges (there are two types of exchanges called &amp;quot;trick and treat&amp;quot;) he/she must decide if he wants to risk the combination of cards obtained by taking (or not) a card from the sixth moon deck (the &amp;ldquo;Red Moon&amp;rdquo;). Here the risk is double or nothing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The player with the highest score combination will receive a Victory Coin. After winning a second time the player will flip his Victory Coin. And after winning a third time, the game is over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Estamos ante un juego familiar en el que es muy importante pensar bien las acciones ya que la probabilidad juega un papel muy importante. La opción de tomar cartas de Luna Roja es muy interesante y aporta un punto divertido y de tensión a la partida dándole ese punto alocado que me encanta. También quiero destacar el reglamento del juego, está cuidado, bien montado y con explicaciones claras y concisas, sin dejar nada en el aire, algo que no siempre ocurre. En conclusión, un buen juego que está cuidado al detalle para amenizar quedadas lúdicas de todo tipo de públicos.\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>In an affluent society, it is more important than ever to instill good financial habits in our children. Why not start with Young Wizards Smart Savings, a collaborative game designed by AXA Hong Kong and the social enterprise People on Board? We encourage parents to join children in the game and help them grasp basic wealth management concepts like saving and spending wisely in a fun interactive setting, while inculcating positive values like civic consciousness and the importance of sharing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On their turn, each player draws three cards from the draw pile. After resolving any charity or vice cards, the player then chooses whether to save or spend. If a player chooses &amp;quot;save&amp;quot;, they put any coin cards in their wallet for use on a future turn. If they save three coins in one turn, they get to advance one space as a bonus. If a player chooses &amp;quot;spend&amp;quot;, they pay the price and move the number of spaces indicated on the item card. Some item cards also have ongoing special effects.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After each player has taken a turn, the spinner is spun and all players must take the action indicated by the spinner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first player to reach the goal at the end of the board is the winner. That player has mastered the importance of saving and spending wisely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Anachronistic aesthetics and wicked machine designs bring the game to life.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Planes Battle Buildings is a 2 to 4 player miniature strategic game. Each player controls a faction of miniature planes or walking buildings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players then draw terrain hex cards to reveal and traverse the unknown landscape. The aim is for each player to gain area control, retain enough resources to maintain and expand their collection of planes or buildings. Conflict arises when players battle over terrain or attempt to pilfer the other player's resources.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Game play is either skirmish mode (where one players wins all) or adventure mode where a scenario is chosen with its own unique set of rules for the players to follow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

With 9 cards, 9 dice, and 9 cubes, you must build a network and connect the buildings to move passengers. You will use cards and icons to perform actions. During each round, play cards to combine icons to perform actions:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Build a link&amp;#10;     Move a passenger&amp;#10;     Build a building&amp;#10;     Upgrade an existing link&amp;#10;     Take money&amp;#10;     Decrease pollution&amp;#10;     Add a new passenger&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If you play two icons from the same card, you must increase your pollution. Your goal is to make as much profit as possible, and you earn money when you move passengers through links and buildings...&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With a second set of cards &amp;mdash; and dice and cubes in a different color &amp;mdash; you can play Railways with two players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the designer&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Dice have certain meanings depending on where you put them (&quot;did I put the railway worker dice to the right of the tracker card?&quot;), and there are way too few cards to make hand management interesting.

      "<description>Death Note &amp;#228;&amp;#186;&amp;#186;&amp;#231;&amp;#139;&amp;#188; (or Death Note Jinrou, meaning Death Note Werewolf) is a draw one, play one card game with social deduction in the setting of the Death Note manga.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Players are first assigned to two teams &amp;ndash; Team L and Team Kira &amp;ndash; depending on which True Identity card they are dealt, which include L and Kira themselves, as well as Kira's believers and L's police allies.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Two item cards are then distributed at random to each player, including the Death Note and Arrest cards that Kira and L must use respectively to attain victory. The rest of the item cards form a draw deck. Each player spends their turn drawing one card and playing one of the three cards in their hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For Team L, victory lies in getting the Arrest card to L and using it to expose the true identity of Kira. For Team Kira, victory lies in getting the Death Note card to Kira and using it to kill off L while trying to stay incognito.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Things won't be that easy, however. Players have no idea which True Identity card the other players hold, meaning that a Kira player could very well pass himself off as L, getting his hand on the Death Note in the process. You'll need to use the item card abilities, as well as your deduction skills, to prevail.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

To protect him in the afterlife, a great army in the form of statues of faithful warriors must be assembled to stand guard in the Emperor's tomb. You will be among those tasked with building this magnificent army.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In Terracotta Army, you represent talented craftsmen and artists laboring to build the wondrous assembly of statues. During the game, you collect resources, upgrade your workers, and seek favor with the Emperor's advisors. Your goal is to play a crucial role in the process of creating the terracotta army, and your success is measured in victory points (VPs). During the game, you and your fellow players build the army together, but after the fifth round of the game is over, only one of you &amp;mdash; the one with the most points &amp;mdash; will stand as the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the game, you place warrior miniatures within the mausoleum, forming groups.  A group's miniatures may belong to multiple players as denoted by the player bases on those miniatures. Multiple separate groups consisting of the same type of miniature may exist within the mausoleum.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You will have many opportunities to score points based on domination and presence. To achieve domination, you must be the only player with the most of the specific resource or type of statue currently being scored. (If you are the only player, you have domination.) To have presence, you must have at least one of the specific resource or type of statue currently being scored.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At the end of the fifth round, the player with the most VPs wins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<comment rating=\"10\" username=\"AdelinDumitru\" value=\"We appreciate many things about board games, but one of them is that sometimes they make you feel really smart when you succeed in taking an optimal action. Terracotta Army abounds in such moments. It’s all about scoring here – you gain points from placing statues; you gain points from having majorities in whatever aspect of the game is rewarded by randomly drawn tiles (having the most of some resource, having placed the most warriors of a specific type, having most warriors in a sector of the board, etc.), and you gain points from majorities based on the positioning of the 2 Inspector pawns (one checking columns, and the other one rows). \n",
      "In order to gain those points, however, you have to use the actions provided by the incredible wheel that stands at the heart of Terracotta Army. Each turn, you have to place one of the workers around the wheel, which has no fewer than 3 rows. Then, you take the 3 actions provided, starting from the inner row outwards. You can rotate either the inner or the middle rows once by spending coins, in order to optimize your actions. But then, you also need coins in order to place master tiles (with powerful effects) and to purchase specialist statues...So you have to take a lot of things into account whenever you spend resources in this game. A nice touch is that the clay tokens used for constructing statues come in 2 states – dry or wet. Each turn, most of the clay you own gets dried, unless it is protected by some of your masters you’ve employed. You can only use wet clay in order to build warriors, so you’ll also have to undertake actions transforming clay from one state to the other.\n",
      "There are 4 warrior types, each with its own special ability, that gets triggered if you use a certain kind of weapon associated with that warrior when you place the statue. You also need the same weapons in order to place specialist statues, leading to even more fascinating decisions that you have to take during the game.\n",
      "Terracotta Army is an excellent game if you enjoy highly interactive euros, where positioning pieces on a board (and sometimes moving them around, as one of the warrior abilities allows you to do that) is of utmost importance.\n",

During the game, players will try to gain Contracts by having the most money each round or by using Merchant&amp;rsquo;s skills. The first player to gain a required number of Contracts is the final winner. There are 15 merchants (12 merchants in the 2018 version of H&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#153;i Ph&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#145;) with 15 unique skills and 5 Ship Cards. Players play a card simultaneously and compare reputation, the players who have the highest and second highest reputation merchant gain money while the lowest merchant triggers skill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each round contains 4 turns (Player plays 4 out of 5 cards in hand). In a 5 player game, there are only 3 turns per round. Money and cards in hand are always hidden (unless the player is required to reveal it).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each Turn has the following steps:&amp;#10;Put a card facedown - Reveal a card - Resolve and reward&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After finishing the last turn (the 4th turn in a game of 3-4 players or the 3rd turn in a game of 5 players), the round ends.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;All players reveal their money and the player with the most money gains 1 Contract card (the top one of the contract deck)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;H&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#153;i Ph&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#145; l&amp;agrave; m&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#153;t tr&amp;ograve; ch&amp;#198;&amp;#161;i th&amp;#225;&amp;#186;&amp;#187; v&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#129; v&amp;#196;&amp;#131;n h&amp;oacute;a Vi&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#135;t Nam d&amp;agrave;nh cho 3-5 ng&amp;#198;&amp;#176;&amp;#225;&amp;#187;&amp;#157;i ch&amp;#198;&amp;#161;i.

      "<description>9-minute Kingdom &amp;ndash; A game that takes 9 or fewer minutes to play!&amp;#10;The goal of the game is to build the kingdom for which we get the most points. The players collect points in two ways: by completing the edicts and by connecting the various icons in their kingdoms.&amp;#10;The game is divided into 9 turns during which the players perform actions simultaneously. The players simultaneously pick one card and play it on the table. Next, they pass the unused cards to the player on the left. Using the received cards, the players play another card and add it to their kingdoms. The game continues to the moment of playing the ninth, final card.&amp;#10;Each played card makes your kingdom grow. You just have to follow 3 simple rules:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;     Apart from the first card, each following card must be placed adjacent to the card which is already on the table.&amp;#10;     Your kingdom has to form 3x3 square.&amp;#10;     The cards can be added freely and don&amp;rsquo;t have to match the ones already added to the kingdom.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After completing their kingdoms the players go to the scoring phase. Firstly, the players receive the edict cards, starting with the &amp;bdquo;Kingsroad&amp;rdquo; edict. It goes to the player with the longest connected road in the kingdom. Next, the rest of the edict cards are handed to the players who met their requirements.&amp;#10;Additionally, the players score points for the individual terrains in their kingdom.  The terrains with the highest number of different symbols generate points, which are then indicated by the scorecards. &amp;#10;The player with the highest score is the winner.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note: The Kickstarter edition included both Expansions and Variants expansions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

If this didn't have the shared scoring goals, this would be dinged for being too solitaire of an experience.  However, as much as I am head down looking at my cards to choose from, I'm counting territories on my opponents kingdom to see what I should cut my losses on or pursue.  At first, it's a lot to crunch, but you learn quickly how to parse terrain type vs symbols vs the road, etc.  I dig it.  The group digs it.  For the playtime and the footprint / portability factor, is a great game.\n",

      "Originally purchased the base game, but then also hunted down a KS copy.  To be honest, all the extra stuff in the KS package didn't really add much to the experience.  The joy of this game (for our group at least) was in the simplicity.  We tried the dragons as well as the blue scoring adjustment cards.  But all's they did was add complexity and slow down scoring, which went against what we felt was the spirit of the game.  The only KS item we have added is the four new edict cards, but the rest is just the base game.  Highly recommended game.\"></comment>\n",

Then you lay out a number of endgame scoring goal cards (#WinnerTakesItAll), and you’re basically ready to go! \n",
      "\n",
      "Place a kingdom card, pass your hand, draft, repeat until you have a 3×3 grid. Scoring is then based on terrain distribution, road length and/or the representation of the buildings. The nature of the end goals (tie = no points) means you have to pay attention to the competition to not invest in a dud, although the second part of scoring is based on purely your own kingdom - how many different building types you have per terrain colour - so you're not 100% dependent on trying to get first place on the end goals. \n",

      "<description>This board game, simply named Charlottesville, is similar to Monopoly; players accumulate properties and try to bankrupt the other players. It was created as a business class project by local high school students, in approximately 1987-1988.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The square board is filled with local Charlottesville, Virginia businesses which purchased the spaces. The box is decorated with the same artwork as part of the board. It comes with four pawns; two dice; round plastic chips to use like houses/hotels; play money sponsored by a local bank (Jefferson National Bank); property cards; two sets of 'Chance'-like cards, sponsored by Hallmark stores and the local Seminole Square shopping center; and a rulebook with a brief description of Charlottesville's history and location.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Note that this game is very different from &amp;quot;All About Charlottesville - Albemarle County, VA&amp;quot; which uses a board made from large puzzle pieces and focuses on visiting businesses to complete a shopping list.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;user summary&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>Len Mam is a card game for 2-4 players. You will become siblings, and cook the traditional Tet tray together&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Summary of games&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game has 3 stages including going to the market, cooking and completing the dish. After the market closes, players will check their trays and score points. The person having the most points will win. There are 4 traditional dishes that will be cooked including bamboo shoot soup, jellied meat,  square glutinous rice cake, and pickled onion. Each dish will correspond to 1 color and need 4 different ingredients to cook&amp;#10;To set up, each player has 5 ingredient cards, the remaining cards will be called a market deck. The turn starts with the oldest person called the eldest brother/sister. The player takes 2 cards from the market deck, chooses 1 of the 2 cards to decide what to cook in turn&amp;#10;Stage 1: Go to the market: You draw ingredient cards from the market deck&amp;#10;Stage 2: Cook: You can put 1-3 cards into the pot. You can put cards that are the same color as the dish you are cooking, or different color cards.&amp;#10;When you play a different color card, you will activate that card's function. However, if there are more different color cards than the number of players + 1, the pot will be destroyed and the dish cannot be completed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Stage 3: Complete the dish: The dish can only be completed when there are 4 ingredients to cook it (not counting the number of cards).

      "In the game, you’ll draw and play cards in order to complete or sabotage a dish. The big sister will start the dish which is one of the four different suits. Players will then play 1-3 cards. If they play a card that’s from a different dish, they’ll get to execute the special action of the card. However, if they played the fourth card that is of a different suit, they would sabotage the dish and all other players would get to pick 1 card in the dish to score.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, to complete a dish, the player would have to play the fourth unique ingredient in the dish’s suit. If they do that, they’ll score all the cards in the dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we have enjoyed most of the games from @nguhanhgames, LÊN MÂM left us a little disappointed. While it’s a simple game of drawing and playing cards, we found that completing a dish was incredibly difficult as we needed to have just the right card at the right time. It was easier to get someone else to sabotage the dish than to score a dish ourselves. And one of the special abilities is to steal 2 cards that another player had scored.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we aren’t huge fans of take-that games, we weren’t the best audience for this game. Additionally, as the game mentions that the goal is to complete dishes, it made us feel that we couldn’t accomplish the goal of the game no matter how hard we tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you see this game as a vicious attempt to outdo your other family members and take credit for the dishes that you finish, that helped us see the game differently. Doing all it takes to ruin your siblings’ plans and gain all the favor for yourself is a retheming that I would recommend to tie it into the gameplay more.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you’re into take-that games where you try to get one over on the other players, this may just be the game for you! A small box game that’s incredibly affordable, do check it out if this is your thing!\"></comment>\n",

      "<description>Life at court could be so simple: the prince loves the princess and the princess loves the prince. So nothing should actually stand in the way of the wedding. If it weren't for the evil wizard ... and the wicked witch ... and that treacherous court marshal!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You all get one character card face down in your hand, four cards are placed next to each other and also face down in the middle of the table. Always present are the prince, the princess, the good and the evil witch, as well as the good and the evil wizard. Who else is added depends on the number of players.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Depending on which card you are currently holding, you have a certain goal for your turn. The prince and princess want to get married, of course. The evil witch wants to cast a spell on the princess, the evil wizard on the prince. But their respective good versions try to prevent this. If they don't succeed, the court marshal laughs up his scheming sleeve. If the seer sees through the traitor's evil intentions, he has fulfilled his mission. And the court jester? He wants to stage a spectacular wedding.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The game is played over several rounds. In each game round, a character card is dealt to each player. Depending on the character, the player pursues a certain game goal. For example, the prince wants to marry the princess and vice versa.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

      "<description>1848: The Golden Spike (aka 1848LT, or &amp;quot;The one true 1862&amp;quot;) is a member of the &amp;quot;18xx&amp;quot; series of games.  The series is based on 1829, by Francis Tresham.  1848LT is set in the western part of the US.&amp;#10;Two to six players represent investors in railroad corporations, spending their initial capital to buy wholly-owned Private and Subsidiary Companies and shares in Public Corporations and the Credit Mobilier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Public Corporations, each controlled by the largest shareholder (its President), build track and run trains in order to earn revenues.  These can be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained to fund further track and rolling stock. &amp;#10;A key feature of 1848LT, as with all the other games in the series, is that the interests of the President and the interests of its shareholders are not identical, so minority shareholders need to be careful in their investments.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Being a President is not without its difficulties, either; bailing out an insolvent Corporation is the sole responsibility of its President.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash; user description&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",
